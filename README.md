# Tmux Top - Summary of tmux on your pc plus the ability to backup and restore

## Overview
TmuxTop is an advanced Tmux process monitoring tool that provides a top-like interface for managing and monitoring processes within Tmux sessions. This tool leverages a terminal user interface (TUI) to display real-time data on CPU and memory usage of processes running in Tmux panes. Additionally, TmuxTop includes features for exporting session data, and backing up and restoring Tmux sessions.

Advanced Usage
--------------

### Real-Time Process Monitoring

TmuxTop provides real-time monitoring of processes within Tmux panes. It displays crucial metrics such as CPU and memory usage, user, process IDs, and more, helping you keep track of system resource consumption and performance.

### Session and Window Navigation

TmuxTop organizes processes by Tmux sessions and windows, making it easy to navigate and view detailed information about each pane. This hierarchical view helps in managing complex setups with multiple sessions and windows efficiently.

### Exporting Data

The export feature allows you to save the current state of Tmux sessions and processes to a JSON file. This can be useful for later analysis or reporting. Simply press 'e' while running TmuxTop or use the `--export` option when starting the script.

### Backing Up and Restoring Sessions

TmuxTop's backup and restore functionalities enable you to save and reload your Tmux environment. This is particularly handy for preserving your workflow across reboots or system changes. Use 'b' to backup and 'r' to restore sessions directly within the interface.
